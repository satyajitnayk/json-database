# Building a JSON Database from Scratch using Golang

Hey there! In this project, I'll be diving into the fascinating world of building my very own database from scratch using Golang. Yes, you heard it right â€“ a database built from the ground up!

## Overview

I am crafting a JSON database, making it akin to MongoDB in terms of its modernity. Think of it as creating your personalized MongoDB experience tailored to your needs. Additionally, I have taken inspiration from CockroachDB, another Golang-based database. While CockroachDB isn't a JSON database, I am very much intrigued by its approach to handling data integrity issues using mutexes.

- **Collection Management**: Create, read, update, and delete collections of records.
- **Record Operations**: Write, read, update, and delete individual records within a collection.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Uses mutexes to ensure safe concurrent access to collections.
- **Logging**: Provides basic logging functionality to track operations.

## Why Golang?

Golang, with its efficiency and conciseness, serves as an excellent choice for this endeavor. Its capabilities make it an ideal candidate for crafting robust databases.

## Key Features

- **JSON Database:** The database will be JSON-based, allowing for flexibility and ease of use.
- **Inspiration from CockroachDB:** Learning from CockroachDB, I aim to implement effective solutions for handling data integrity issues.

## Acknowledgments

This project draws inspiration from the vibrant Golang community, the MongoDB project, and the innovative approaches of CockroachDB.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
